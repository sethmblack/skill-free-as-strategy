# Free as Strategy

Design a "free" intervention—goods, services, knowledge, or experiences—that challenges scarcity assumptions and models alternative systems.

---

## When to Use

- Want to demonstrate an alternative to current economic arrangements
- User asks "How do I show people another way is possible?"
- Need to build community around shared resources
- Challenging commodification of something that should be freely available
- Building a movement through generosity rather than transactions

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| system_challenged | Yes | Current practice or system being critiqued |
| resource | Yes | What will be given freely (goods, services, knowledge, etc.) |
| community | No | Who will be served by this intervention |
| message | No | Ideological point connecting "free" to broader values |
| sustainability | No | Constraints on how long this can run |

## The Seven Models of Free

Hoffman and the Diggers developed multiple frameworks for "free" as political action:

### 1. Free Store
Give away goods that society says must be bought.

**Mechanism:** Collect donations, redistribute without charge
**Message:** Property is arbitrary; abundance exists, it's just hoarded
**Example:** The Digger Free Store in Haight-Ashbury

### 2. Free Food
Feed people in public spaces without transactions.

**Mechanism:** Cook food, serve it to anyone, refuse payment
**Message:** Food is a right, not a commodity
**Example:** Food Not Bombs, Digger free meals in the Panhandle

### 3. Free Events
Create cultural experiences outside the market.

**Mechanism:** Concerts, gatherings, workshops with no admission
**Message:** Culture belongs to everyone; don't let them monetize joy
**Example:** Free concerts in Central Park, Woodstock's free-farm ethos

### 4. Free Press
Distribute information without subscription or paywall.

**Mechanism:** Newsletters, zines, pamphlets at no cost
**Message:** Information should be free; don't let them control knowledge
**Example:** Underground press movement, samizdat

### 5. Free Shelter (Crash Pads)
Offer housing to travelers and those in need.

**Mechanism:** Network of homes open to strangers
**Message:** Housing is a right; hospitality over hoarding
**Example:** The Digger crash pads, CouchSurfing's original spirit

### 6. Free University
Share knowledge outside credentialed institutions.

**Mechanism:** Classes taught by anyone who knows something to anyone who wants to learn
**Message:** Education is not a product; wisdom can't be bought
**Example:** Free universities of the 1960s, Skillshares

### 7. Free Box
Leave useful items for others to take.

**Mechanism:** A physical container where people leave and take things freely
**Message:** One person's excess is another's need; circulation over accumulation
**Example:** "Take what you need, leave what you can" boxes

## The Strategic Framework

### Why "Free" Is Political

"Free" is not charity. Charity reinforces hierarchy (giver above receiver). "Free" models a different system entirely:

- It demonstrates that scarcity is often manufactured
- It creates temporary autonomous zones outside market logic
- It builds community through giving rather than transactions
- It makes people question why things cost money at all

### The Three Questions

Before designing your intervention, answer:

1. **What is artificially scarce?** What does your community need that's hoarded or commodified unnecessarily?
2. **Who benefits from the scarcity?** Whose power depends on keeping this expensive or rare?
3. **What happens when we make it free?** How does behavior change when the transaction disappears?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Free Intervention Design: [Name]

### System Challenged
[What current arrangement is being critiqued]

### The Resource
[What will be given freely]

### Model Type
[Which of the seven models, or a hybrid]

### Operational Design
- **What:** Exactly what is provided
- **Where:** Location/distribution method
- **When:** Timing/frequency
- **Who provides:** Where resources come from
- **Who receives:** Who can access it

### The Message
[How this connects to broader values/critique]

### Community Building
[How this creates connection, not just distribution]

### Sustainability Plan
- **Resource renewal:** How to keep materials/energy flowing
- **Volunteer structure:** Who does the work
- **Growth path:** Can this scale? Should it?

### Success Metrics
[How you know it's working beyond just "stuff got given away"]

### Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [Strategy] |
| [Risk 2] | [Strategy] |
```

---

## Constraints

- "Free" must be genuinely free—no hidden costs, obligations, or strings
- Never position recipients as charity cases—this is mutual aid, not philanthropy
- Sustainability must be considered—burnout serves no one
- The message must connect to something larger—free without meaning is just giveaway
- Don't compete with people trying to make a living—target abundance/hoarding, not workers

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Mental health services are impossibly expensive. I have a network of licensed therapists who want to help. How do we challenge this system?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Free Intervention Design: The Listening Project

### System Challenged
Mental health care as luxury good. Therapy costs $150-300/hour, insurance is byzantine, waitlists are months long. Meanwhile, a mental health crisis epidemic. The system treats healing as a product.

### The Resource
One-on-one therapeutic conversations with licensed professionals.

### Model Type
Hybrid: Free University (sharing expertise) + Free Service (professional services without transaction)

### Operational Design
- **What:** 45-minute therapeutic sessions, no diagnosis codes, no insurance, no payment
- **Where:** Public libraries (free meeting rooms), parks (walking therapy), online
- **When:** "Free Therapy Saturdays" - once monthly, by appointment
- **Who provides:** Network of licensed therapists donating time (rotating schedule, 4 hours max per therapist per month to prevent burnout)
- **Who receives:** Anyone who shows up—no income verification, no intake forms beyond safety screening

### The Message
"Healing shouldn't require a credit check. If we have therapists and people who need to talk, why does money stand between them?"

This directly challenges:
- Healthcare as commodity
- The idea that care must be transactional
- Accessibility barriers that aren't about actual scarcity

### Community Building
- Recipients are invited to "pay forward" in any way—volunteering, bringing snacks, sharing skills
- Monthly gathering (optional) where attendees can connect
- No pressure to share therapeutic content—just presence
- Therapists rotate so it's community care, not individual saviors

### Sustainability Plan
- **Resource renewal:** Therapists commit to one Saturday per quarter minimum; recruit continuously
- **Volunteer structure:** Non-therapist volunteers handle scheduling, space booking, snacks
- **Growth path:** Document model for other cities; don't centralize—let it fork

### Success Metrics
- People served per month (track it)
- Therapist retention (are providers burning out?)
- Word of mouth referrals (organic growth)
- Policy conversations sparked (are legislators noticing?)
- NOT "did people pay us back"—that's not the point

### Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Therapist burnout | Strict hour limits, rotating schedule, appreciation events |
| Liability concerns | Clear scope (support, not ongoing treatment), safety protocols |
| Overwhelmed demand | Waitlist with transparent communication; recruit more therapists |
| Perceived as "lesser" care | Same therapists who charge $200/hour are doing this—quality isn't reduced |
| Exploitation by those who could pay | Don't means-test—the message is more important than perfect targeting |

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Abbie Hoffman** expert persona. The Diggers and Yippies understood that "free" is a revolutionary act. "You measure democracy by the freedom it gives its dissidents, not the freedom it gives its assimilated conformists... The first duty of a revolutionary is to get away with it." Giving things away isn't just nice—it's a demonstration that another world is possible.
